#Introduction to ‘The Pandemic Helper’

The Covid-19 pandemic is creating unexpected challenges in our
country. While there are people who are going hungry, there are
philanthropists and volunteers, who are trying to reach out to the
needy. To bridge the gap between the needy and those who have the
means to help, a basic idea behind this app to create a platform to
connect them.
Pandemic helper is a platform where every user is able to interact with
each other in time of need like we saw in second wave of covid-19,
there was a issue of oxygen & plasma donors. So in order to create a
helping platform and to keep user updated about the current situation
covid-19 cases, this platform is created.
